## Why use CloudFormation?

CloudFormation is an excellent Infrastructure-as-Code tool that supports transactional deploys (automatically rolling back on failure), has a rich construct library, and does not require separate state management like Terraform or Pulumi.

Even if you don't want to write YAML/JSON files directly, there are multiple frameworks that let you write your CloudFormation config in more ergonomic, general-purpose languages.

## Why use Spacelift with CloudFormation?

Spacelift helps you manage the complexities and compliance challenges of using CloudFormation. It brings with it a GitOps flow, so your infrastructure repository is synced with your CloudFormation Stacks, and pull requests show you a preview of what they're planning to change. It also has an extensive selection of [policies](../../concepts/policy/README.md), which lets you [automate compliance checks](../../concepts/policy/terraform-plan-policy.md) and [build complex multi-stack workflows](../../concepts/policy/trigger-policy.md).

You can also use Spacelift to mix and match Terraform, Pulumi, and CloudFormation Stacks and have them talk to one another. For example, you can set up Terraform Stacks to provision required infrastructure (like an ECS/EKS cluster with all its dependencies) and then connect that to a CloudFormation Stack which then transactionally deploys your services there using [trigger policies](../../concepts/policy/trigger-policy.md) and the Spacelift provider [run resources](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spacelift-io/spacelift/latest/docs/resources/run){: rel="nofollow"} for workflow orchestration and [Contexts](../../concepts/configuration/context.md#remote-state-alternative-terraform-specific) to export Terraform outputs as CloudFormation input parameters.

## Does Spacelift support CloudFormation frameworks?

Yes! We support [AWS CDK](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk){: rel="nofollow"}, [AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/){: rel="nofollow"}, and the [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/){: rel="nofollow"}. You can read more about it in the relevant subpages of this document.
