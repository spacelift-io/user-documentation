# Support knowledge base

When Spacelift customers reach out to support to solve a problem, we create [knowledge base articles](https://support.spacelift.io/) to help others fix the same issue.

You can search for articles related to your problem within the knowledge base or navigate through the categories.

If you can't find a solution in the docs or support knowledge base, please reach out to our [support team](../product/support/README.md).
