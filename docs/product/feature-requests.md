# Feature Requests

## We value your feedback

At Spacelift we really value your feedback on how to improve our platform. We strive to engage with you at every step of our development journey, whether it’s evaluating feature requests or doing user research (if you’re interested in having more impact, go ahead and check out our [Test Pilot Programme](https://spacelift.io/test-pilot-program)).

We value your ideas and will always be honest about how feasible or viable they are for our company. We hope you understand!

Please also remember that some ideas might be too complex, take too long to implement, or not be the best use of our time for now.

## Submitting a Feature Request:

{% if is_saas() %}
You can submit a feature request in Spacelift by selecting 'Feedback Center' from the left menu or by visiting our [dashboard](https://spacelift.featurebase.app/), where you can also review other feature requests.
{% endif %}

{% if is_self_hosted() %}
You can submit a feature request by visiting our [dashboard](https://spacelift.featurebase.app/), where you can also review other feature requests. To proceed, you'll need to sign up in the tool. This allows us to ask follow-up questions and keep you informed about status changes.
{% endif %}

- Check if a similar feature request already exists. If yes, add a vote and comment on the idea. If you don’t find anything similar, create a new one.

- One idea = one feature request.

- Be clear and concise.

- Specify not only the solution you wish for but also the problem you are trying to solve with that solution, or provide a use case. This will help us better understand what you need and evaluate if your proposal is the best way to solve it.

- Let us know if there’s a workaround you are currently using.

- The title really matters. It makes the idea searchable and enables others to vote on your ideas.

- Be honest about the priority. Nice to have it doesn’t mean it will not be delivered.

## Our Feature Requests flow - statuses and what they mean:

1. **Under review** is the status for all newly created feature requests. Voting on those ideas is not possible, as we want to review them first.

    1. If there is already an existing FR, we will merge it.

    2. **Rejected**: Something we will not deliver. Whether it’s because it does not align with our strategy or for another reason, we will always provide a justification for a rejected idea.

2. **Gathering feedback**: We evaluated it and believe it makes sense; however, we don’t guarantee any prioritization. We will keep an eye on the vote numbers and similar upcoming feature requests.

3. **Planned**: We accepted the idea and are committed to delivering it.

4. **In progress**: Our development team is currently working on it.

5. **Completed**: Request is live on production.

We aim to evaluate all feature requests within two weeks. However, there may be times when factors like holidays or events extend this timeframe. If your request is urgent, please contact your Customer Success representative.
