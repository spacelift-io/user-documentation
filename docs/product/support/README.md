# Support

Spacelift offers a variety of support options for all customers and users on both paid and free tiers. You should be able to find help using the resources linked below, regardless of how you use Spacelift. There are many ways to contact Support, but the first step for most people should be to search our documentation.

If you can't find an answer to your question, or you are affected by an outage, then customers who are in a paid tier should start by consulting our statement of support while being mindful of what is outside of the scope of support.
