## 2. BETA PRODUCT DESCRIPTION AND LIMITATIONS

**2.1 Product Nature.** The Beta Product is a separate yet integrated with the Spacelift Platform product that assists in the creation of infrastructure resources through natural language. Users interact with it through external LLM clients, describing desired infrastructure in natural language rather than writing code. Such requests are translated into direct cloud provider API calls while all execution, policy enforcement, and state storage occur within Spacelift's systems. Results, and infrastructure state are visible in the Spacelift Platform UI, allowing users to monitor and manage what was created.

**2.2 Organization-Wide Access.** Upon activation via the feature flag in the Spacelift Platform, the Beta Product will be available to all authorized users within your organization who have appropriate access permissions to the Spacelift Platform.

**2.3 Free of Charge.** The Beta Product is provided free of charge during the beta period. This free access: (i) may be revoked at any time, (ii) does not guarantee free access to any future commercial version, and (iii) creates no obligation for us to provide any services.

**2.4 Acceptance and Eligibility.** Your participation in the Beta Product release is subject to our approval and may be revoked at any time. You must comply with all applicable terms, policies, and guidelines we provide. We may limit the number of participants, geographic availability, or duration of the Beta Product release at our sole discretion.
