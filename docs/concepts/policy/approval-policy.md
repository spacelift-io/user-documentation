# Approval policy

Approval policies allow organizations to create sophisticated run review and approval flows that reflect their preferred workflow, security goals, and business objectives. Without an explicit approval policy, **anyone with write access** to a stack can create a [run](../run/README.md) or [task](../run/task.md). An approval policy can make this process more granular and contextual.

Runs can be reviewed by approval policies when they enter one of three states: [queued](../run/README.md#queued), [unconfirmed](../run/tracked.md#unconfirmed), or [pending review](../run/proposed.md#pending-review). If a stack has [autodeploy](../stack/stack-settings.md#autodeploy) enabled, then the approval policy will not be evaluated here, and you should use a [plan policy](../policy/terraform-plan-policy.md) to warn, which will force the stack into an unconfirmed state, at which point the approval policy will get evaluated as a safeguard.

When a [queued](../run/README.md#queued) run needs approval, it will not be scheduled until that approval is received. If the run is of a blocking type, it will block newer runs from scheduling too. A [queued](../run/README.md#queued) run that's pending approval can be [canceled](../run/README.md#common-run-states) at any point.

## Review a run

In this example, a queued run is waiting for a human review, and the last approval policy evaluation returned an _Undecided_ decision.

1. Navigate to the _Runs_ tab and select the run that needs review.
      - You can also access runs for a specific stack by navigating to the _Stacks_ tab, clicking the name of the stack, and clicking the run to review in the _Tracked Run_ section.
2. Click **Review** in the top right.

3. Review the changes, then click **Approve** if the run can continue, or **Reject** if the run should be canceled.
      - If desired, you can leave a comment from your review in the text box.
    ![Approve or Reject changes](<../../assets/screenshots/Mouse_Highlight_Overlay_and_Resource_in_a_separate_file_路_Bacon (1).png>)
4. Click **Submit Review**.
5. If you approved the run, the approval policy will evaluate to Approved, thus unblocking the run.
    ![Run unblocked by approval](<../../assets/screenshots/Mouse_Highlight_Overlay_and_Resource_in_a_separate_file_路_Bacon.png>)

When an [unconfirmed](../run/tracked.md#unconfirmed) run needs approval, you will not be able to [confirm](../run/tracked.md#confirmed) it until that approval is received. The run can, however, be [discarded](../run/tracked.md#discarded) at any point:

![Discard unconfirmed run](<../../assets/screenshots/Mouse_Highlight_Overlay_and_Resource_in_a_separate_file_路_Bacon (3).png>)

The run review and approval process is very similar to GitHub's Pull Request review. The only exception is that it's the Rego policy (rather than a set of checkboxes and dropdowns) that defines the exact conditions to approve the run.

!!! tip
    If separate run approval and confirmation steps sound confusing, think about how GitHub's Pull Requests work. You can approve a PR before merging it in a separate step. A PR approval means "I'm ok with this being merged", while a run approval means "I'm OK with that action being executed".

## Rules

Your approval policy can define the following boolean rules:

- **approve**: The run is approved and no longer requires (or allows) review.
- **reject**: The run fails immediately.

While the `approve` rule must be defined in order for the run to be able to progress, you don't need to define the `reject` rule. If `reject` rules are undefined, runs that look invalid can be [canceled](../run/README.md#common-run-states) or [discarded](../run/tracked.md#discarded) manually.

Any given policy evaluation can also return `false` on both `approve` and `reject` rules. This only means that the result is yet `undecided`, and more reviews will be necessary. A perfect example would be a policy that requires 2 approvals for a given job; the first review is not supposed to set the `approve` value to `true`.

!!! info
    Users must have [`write`](./stack-access-policy.md#readers-and-writers) or [`admin`](./login-policy.md#purpose) access to the stack to be able to approve changes.

### How it works

When a user reviews the run, Spacelift persists the review and passes it to the approval policy (along with other reviews), plus some information about the run and its stack.

The same user can review the same run as many times as they want, but **only their newest review** will be presented to the approval policy. This mechanism allows you to change your mind, very similar to Pull Request reviews in GitHub.

## Data input schema

This schema is an informational example, as JSON doesn't support comments by design. You can play with this sample (and others) using the [policy workbench](./README.md#policy-workbench) or [policy templates](./README.md#import-policy-templates).

Each approval policy request will receive this data input schema:

## Approval policy examples

These [policy examples can be imported](./README.md#import-policy-templates) directly into your Spacelift.

!!! tip
    We maintain a [library of example policies](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacelift-policies-example-library/tree/main/examples/approval){: rel="nofollow"} ready to use or alter to meet your specific needs.

    If you cannot find what you are looking for below or in the library, please reach out to [our support](../../product/support/README.md#contact-support) and we will craft a policy to do exactly what you need.

### Two approvals, no rejections

In this example, each Unconfirmed run (including proposed runs triggered by Git events) will require two approvals. Additionally, the run should have no rejections. Anyone who rejects the run will need to go back and approve it in order for the run to go through.

!!! info
    We suggest requiring more than one review because one approval should come from the run/commit author to indicate that they're aware of what they're doing, especially if their VCS handle is different than their IdP handle. This is something [we practice internally at Spacelift](https://spacelift.io/blog/flexible-backoffice-tool-using-slack){: rel="nofollow"}.

```opa
package spacelift

approve { input.run.state != "UNCONFIRMED" }

approve {
  count(input.reviews.current.approvals) > 1
  count(input.reviews.current.rejections) == 0
}
```

### Two to approve, two to reject

This is a variation of the above policy that will automatically fail any run that receives more than one rejection.

```opa
package spacelift

approve { input.run.state != "UNCONFIRMED" }
approve { count(input.reviews.current.approvals) > 1 }
reject  { count(input.reviews.current.rejections) > 1 }
```

### Require approval for a task command not on the allowlist

```opa
package spacelift

allowlist := ["ps", "ls", "rm -rf /"]

# Approve when not a task.
approve { input.run.type != "TASK" }

# Approve when allowlisted.
approve { input.run.command == allowlist[_] }

# Approve with two or more approvals.
approve { count(input.reviews.current.approvals) > 1 }
```

Options for input.run.type include `PROPOSED`, `TRACKED`, `TASK`, `TESTING`, `DESTROY`.

### Combining multiple rules

Usually, you will apply different rules to different types of jobs. Since approval policies are attached to stacks, you'll want to be smart about how you combine different rules. Here's how you can combine two of the above approval flows as an example:

```opa
package spacelift

# First, define all conditions that require explicit
# user approval.
requires_approval { input.run.state == "UNCONFIRMED" }
requires_approval { input.run.type == "TASK" }

# Then, automatically approve all other jobs.
approve { not requires_approval }

# Autoapprove some task commands. We don't check for run type
# because only tasks will the have "command" field set.
task_allowlist := ["ps", "ls", "rm -rf /"]
approve { input.run.command == task_allowlist[_] }

# Two approvals and no rejections to approve.
approve {
  count(input.reviews.current.approvals) > 1
  count(input.reviews.current.rejections) == 0
}
```

### Role-based approval

Sometimes you want to give specific roles (but not others) the power to approve certain workloads. The policy below approves an unconfirmed run or a task when either a Director approves it, or **both** DevOps and Security roles approve it:

```opa
package spacelift

# First, define all conditions that require explicit
# user approval.
requires_approval { input.run.state == "UNCONFIRMED" }
requires_approval { input.run.type == "TASK" }
approve           { not requires_approval }

approvals := input.reviews.current.approvals

# Define what it means to be approved by a Director, DevOps and Security.
director_approval { approvals[_].session.teams[_] == "Director" }
devops_approval   { approvals[_].session.teams[_] == "DevOps" }
security_approval { approvals[_].session.teams[_] == "Security" }

# Approve when a single Director approves:
approve { director_approval }

# Approve when both DevOps and Security approve:
approve { devops_approval; security_approval }
```

### Require private worker pool

You might want to ensure that your runs are always scheduled on a [private worker pool](../worker-pools/README.md#private-worker-pool). You could use an approval policy similar to this ones:

```opa
package spacelift

# Approve any runs on private workers
approve { not input.stack.worker_pool.public }

# Reject any runs on public workers
reject { input.stack.worker_pool.public }
```

You may want to [auto-attach this policy](./README.md#automatically-with-labels) to some, if not all, of your stacks.

### Use more descriptive approvals

Sometimes it is worth adding notes about approval/rejection to see why without rego code analysis.

```opa
package spacelift

allowlist := ["ps", "ls"]
denylist := ["rm -rf /"]

approve_with_note[note] {
  input.run.type == "TASK"
  input.run.command == allowlist[_]
  note := sprintf("always approve tasks with command %s", [input.run.command])
}

reject_with_note[note] {
  input.run.type == "TASK"
  input.run.command == denylist[_]
  note := sprintf("always reject tasks with command %s", [input.run.command])
}
```
