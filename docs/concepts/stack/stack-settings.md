# Stack settings

This article explains all the settings that can be configured **directly on the stack**. However, these are not the only settings that influence how [runs](../run/README.md) and [tasks](../run/task.md) within a stack are processed. Other factors, such as [environment variables](../configuration/environment.md), attached [contexts](../configuration/context.md), [runtime configuration](../configuration/runtime-configuration/README.md), and various integrations, also play a significant role.

## Common settings

### Administrative

This setting determines whether a stack has administrative privileges within its [space](../spaces/README.md). Administrative stacks receive an API token that grants them elevated access to a subset of the Spacelift API, which is used by the [Terraform provider](../../vendors/terraform/terraform-provider.md). This allows them to create, update, and destroy Spacelift resources.

!!! info
    Administrative stacks get the Admin role in the [space they belong to](../spaces/access-control.md#access-control).

The primary use case for administrative stacks is to declaratively manage Spacelift resources, such as other stacks, their [environments](../configuration/environment.md), [contexts](../configuration/context.md), [policies](../policy/README.md), [modules](../../vendors/terraform/module-registry.md), and [worker pools](../worker-pools). This approach helps avoid manual configuration, often referred to as "ClickOps."

Another common pattern is exporting stack outputs as a [context](../configuration/context.md) to avoid exposing the entire state through Terraform's remote state or external storage mechanisms like [AWS Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html){: rel="nofollow"} or [Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/){: rel="nofollow"}.

For more details, refer to the [help article on Spacelift's Terraform provider](../../vendors/terraform/terraform-provider.md).

### Autodeploy

This setting determines whether changes to the stack can be [applied](../run/tracked.md#applying) automatically. When Autodeploy is enabled (_true_), any change to the tracked branch will be automatically [applied](../run/tracked.md#applying) if the [planning](../run/proposed.md#planning) phase is successful and there are no plan policy warnings.

You might consider enabling Autodeploy if you always perform a code review before merging to the tracked branch or if you rely on [plan policies](../policy/terraform-plan-policy.md) to flag potential issues automatically. If every change undergoes a meaningful human review by stack [writers](../policy/stack-access-policy.md#readers-and-writers), requiring an additional step to confirm deployment may be unnecessary. For more information, refer to the [dedicated section](../policy/terraform-plan-policy.md#automated-code-review) on using plan policies for automated code reviews.

When Autodeploy is enabled, [Approval policies](../policy/approval-policy.md) are only evaluated during the queued stage, not during the unconfirmed state.

### Autoretry

This setting determines whether obsolete proposed changes are retried automatically. When Autoretry is enabled (_true_), any Pull Requests to the [tracked branch](#vcs-integration-and-repository) that conflict with an applied change will be reevaluated based on the updated state.

This feature saves you from manually retrying runs on Pull Requests when the state changes. It also provides greater confidence that the proposed changes will match the actual changes after merging the Pull Request.

Autoretry is only supported for [stacks](./README.md) with a private [Worker Pool](../worker-pools) attached.

### Customizing workflow

Spacelift workflows can be customized by adding extra commands to be executed before and after specific phases:

- [Initialization](../run/README.md#initializing) (`before_init` and `after_init`)
- [Planning](../run/proposed.md#planning) (`before_plan` and `after_plan`)
- [Applying](../run/tracked.md#applying) (`before_apply` and `after_apply`)
- Destroying (`before_destroy` and `after_destroy`)
    - Used during [module test cases](../run/test-case.md)
    - Used by stacks during destruction with corresponding [stack_destructor_resource](../stack/stack-dependencies.md#ordered-stack-creation-and-deletion)
- [Performing](../run/task.md#performing-a-task) (`before_perform` and `after_perform`)
- Finally (`after_run`): Executed after each actively processed run, regardless of its outcome. These hooks have access to an environment variable called `TF_VAR_spacelift_final_run_state`, which indicates the final state of the run.

All hooks, including `after_run`, execute on the worker. If the run is terminated outside the worker (e.g., canceled or discarded), or if there is an issue setting up the workspace or starting the worker container, the hooks will not fire.

These commands can serve two main purposes: modifying the workspace (e.g., setting up symlinks or moving files) or running validations using tools like [`tfsec`](https://github.com/tfsec/tfsec){: rel="nofollow"}, [`tflint`](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint){: rel="nofollow"}, or `terraform fmt`.

!!! tip
    Avoid using newlines (`\n`) in hooks. Spacelift chains commands with double ampersands (`&&`), and using newlines can hide non-zero exit codes if the last command in the block succeeds. To run multiple commands, either add multiple hooks or use a script as a [mounted file](../configuration/environment.md#mounted-files) and call it in the hook.

    Additionally, using a semicolon (`;`) in hooks will cause subsequent commands to run even if the phase fails. Use `&&` or wrap your hook in parentheses to ensure "after" commands only execute if the phase succeeds.

!!! danger
    When a run resumes after being paused (e.g., for confirmation or approval), the remaining phases run in a new container. Any tools installed in earlier phases will not be available. To avoid this, bake the tools into a [custom runner image](../../integrations/docker.md#customizing-the-runner-image).

!!! info
    If a "before" hook fails (non-zero exit code), the corresponding phase will not execute. Similarly, if a phase fails, none of the "after" hooks will execute unless the hook uses a semicolon (`;`). For more details, refer to the tip above.

{% if is_saas() %}
The workflow can be customized using either the [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spacelift-io/spacelift/latest/docs/resources/stack){: rel="nofollow"} or the GUI. The GUI provides an intuitive editor that allows you to add, remove, and reorder commands using drag-and-drop functionality. Commands preceding a phase are "before" hooks, while those following it are "after" hooks:

![](<../../assets/screenshots/context/stack_init_phase_hooks.png>)
{% else %}
The workflow can be customized using either the [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spacelift-io/spacelift/latest/docs/resources/stack){: rel="nofollow"} or the GUI. The GUI allows you to select a phase, add commands before and after it, and reorder them using drag-and-drop functionality. Commands preceding a phase are "before" hooks, while those following it are "after" hooks:

![](<../../assets/screenshots/Mouse_Highlight_Overlay (7).png>)
{% endif %}

Commands run in the same shell session as the phase itself, so the phase will have access to any shell variables exported by preceding scripts. Environment variables are preserved across phases.

!!! info
    These scripts can be overridden by the [runtime configuration](../configuration/runtime-configuration/README.md) specified in the `.spacelift/config.yml` file.

{% if is_saas() %}

#### Note on hook ordering

Hooks added to stacks and contexts attached to them follow distinct ordering principles. Stack hooks are organized through a drag-and-drop mechanism, while context hooks adhere to prioritization based on context priority. Additionally, auto-attached contexts are arranged alphabetically or reversed alphabetically depending on the operation type (before/after).

Hooks from manually and auto-attached contexts can only be edited from their respective views.

In the before phase, hook priorities work as follows:

- context hooks (based on set priorities)
- context auto-attached hooks (reversed alphabetically)
- stack hooks

In the after phase, hook priorities work as follows:

- stack hooks
- context auto-attached hooks (alphabetically)
- context hooks (reversed priorities)

Let's suppose you have 4 contexts attached to a stack:

- context_a (auto-attached)
- context_b (auto-attached)
- context_c (priority 0)
- context_d (priority 5)

In all of these contexts, we have added hooks that echo the context name before and after phases. To add to this, we will also add two static hooks on the stack level that will do a simple "echo stack".

Before phase order:

- context_c
- context_d
- context_b
- context_a
- stack

After phase order:

- stack
- context_a
- context_b
- context_d
- context_c

{% endif %}

### Runtime commands

Spacelift can handle special commands to change the workflow behavior.
Runtime commands use the echo command in a specific format.

You could use those commands in any lifecycle step of the workflow.

{% if is_saas() %}
![stack_runtime_command](../../assets/screenshots/context/stack_hooks.png)
{% else %}
![stack_runtime_command](../../assets/screenshots/stack_runtime_command.png)
{% endif %}

```bash
echo "::command arg1 arg2"
```

Below is a list of supported commands. See the more detailed doc after this table.

| Command                   | Description                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`::add-mask`](#add-mask) | Adds a set of values that should be masked in log output |

#### ::add-mask

When you mask a value, it is treated as a secret and will be redacted in the logs output.
Each masked word separated by whitespace is replaced with five `*` characters.

##### Example

```bash
# Multiple masks can be set with a single command
echo "::add-mask secret-string another-secret-string"

# You can pull a secret dynamically, for example here we can mask the account ID
echo "::add-mask $(aws sts get-caller-identity | jq -r .Account)"
```

### Enable local preview

Indicates whether creating [proposed Runs](../run/proposed.md) based on user-uploaded local workspaces is allowed.

If this is enabled, you can use [spacectl](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacectl){: rel="nofollow"} to create a proposed run based on the directory you're in:

```bash
spacectl stack local-preview --id <stack-id>
```

!!! danger
    This in effect allows anybody with write access to the Stack to execute arbitrary code with access to all the environment variables configured in the Stack.

    Use with caution.

### Enable well known secret masking

This setting determines if secret patterns will be automatically redacted from logs. If enabled, the following secrets will be masked from logs:

- AWS Access Key Id
- Azure AD Client Secret
- Azure Connection Strings (`AccountKey=...`, `SharedAccessSignature=...`)
- GitHub PAT
- GitHub Fine-Grained PAT
- GitHub App Token
- GitHub Refresh Token
- GitHub OAuth Access Token
- JWT tokens
- Slack Token
- PGP Private Key
- RSA Private Key
- PEM block with BEGIN PRIVATE KEY header

### Name and description

Stack name and description are pretty self-explanatory. The required _name_ is what you'll see in the stack list on the home screen and menu selection dropdown. Make sure that it's informative enough to be able to immediately communicate the purpose of the stack, but short enough so that it fits nicely in the dropdown, and no important information is cut off.

The optional _description_ is completely free-form and it supports [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/){: rel="nofollow"}. This is perhaps a good place for a thorough explanation of the purpose of the stack, perhaps a link or two, and an obligatory cat GIF.

!!! warning
    Based on the original _name_, Spacelift generates an immutable slug that serves as a unique identifier of this stack. If the name and the slug diverge significantly, things may become confusing.

    So even though you can change the stack name at any point, we strongly discourage all non-trivial changes.

### Labels

Labels are arbitrary, user-defined tags that can be attached to Stacks. A single Stack can have an arbitrary number of these, but they **must** be unique. Labels can be used for any purpose, including UI filtering, but one area where they shine most is user-defined [policies](../policy/README.md#policy-library) which can modify their behavior based on the presence (or lack thereof) of a particular label.

There are some **magic** labels that you can add to your stacks. These labels add/remove functionalities based on their presence.

List of the most useful labels:

- **infracost** -- Enables Infracost on your stack
- **feature:enable_log_timestamps** -- Enables timestamps on run logs.
- **feature:add_plan_pr_comment** -- Enables Pull Request Plan Commenting. It is deprecated. Please use [Notification policies](../policy/notification-policy.md#complex-example-adding-a-comment-to-a-pull-request-about-changed-resources) instead.
- **feature:disable_pr_comments** - Disables Pull Request Comments
- **feature:disable_pr_delta_comments** - Disables Pull Request Delta Comments
- **feature:disable_resource_sanitization** -- Disables resource sanitization
- **feature:ignore_runtime_config** -- Ignores .spacelift/config
- **terragrunt** -- Old way of using Terragrunt from the Terraform backend
- **ghenv: Name** -- GitHub Deployment environment (defaults to the stack name)
- **ghenv: -** -- Disables the creation of GitHub deployment environments
- **autoattach:autoattached_label** -- Used for policies/contexts to autoattach the policy/contexts to all stacks containing `autoattached_label`
- **feature:k8s_keep_using_prune_white_list_flag** -- sets `--prune-whitelist` flag instead of `--prune-allowlist` for the template parameter `.PruneWhiteList` in the Kubernetes custom workflow.

### Project root

Project root points to the directory within the repo where the project should start executing. This is especially useful for monorepos, or indeed repositories hosting multiple somewhat independent projects. This setting plays very well with [Git push policies](../policy/push-policy/README.md), allowing you to easily express generic rules on what it means for the stack to be affected by a code change. In the absence of push policies, any changes made to the project root and any paths specified by project globs will trigger Spacelift runs.

!!! info
    The project root can be overridden by the [runtime configuration](../configuration/runtime-configuration/README.md#project_root-setting) specified in the `.spacelift/config.yml` file.

### Project globs

The project globs option allows you to specify files and directories outside of the project root that the stack cares about. In the absence of push policies, any changes made to the project root and any paths specified by project globs will trigger Spacelift runs.

!!! warning
    Project globs do not mount the files or directories in your project root.  They are used primarily for triggering your stack when for example there are changes to a module outside of the project root.

![](../../assets/screenshots/stack/settings/source-code_project-globs.png)

You aren't required to add any project globs if you don't want to, but you have the option to add as many project globs as you want for a stack.

Under the hood, the project globs option takes advantage of the [doublestar.Match](https://github.com/bmatcuk/doublestar?tab=readme-ov-file#match){: rel="nofollow"} function to do pattern matching.

Example matches:

- Any directory or file: `**`
- A directory and all of its content: `dir/*`
- A directory path and all of its subdirectories and files: `dir/**`
- Match all files with a specific extension: `dir/*.tf`
- Match all files that start with a string, end with another and have a predefined number of chars in the middle -- `data-???-report` will match three chars between data and report
- Match all files that start with a string, and finish with any character from a sequence: `dir/instance[0-9].tf`

As you can see in the example matches, these are the regex rules that you are already accustomed to.

### VCS integration and repository

![](<../../assets/screenshots/stack/settings/source-code_vcs-details.png>)

We have two types of integrations types: default and Space-level. Default integrations will be always available for all stacks, however Space-level integrations will be available only for stacks that are in the same Space as the integration or have access to it [via inheritance](../spaces/access-control.md#inheritance). Read more about VCS integrations in the [source control](../../integrations/source-control/README.md) page.

_Repository_ and _branch_ point to the location of the source code for a stack. The repository must either belong to the GitHub account linked to Spacelift  (its choice may further be limited by the way the Spacelift GitHub app has been installed) or to the GitLab server integrated with your Spacelift account. For more information about these integrations, please refer to our [GitHub](../../integrations/source-control/github.md) and [GitLab](../../integrations/source-control/gitlab.md) documentation respectively.

Thanks to the strong integration between GitHub and Spacelift, the link between a stack and a repository can survive the repository being renamed in GitHub. If you're storing your repositories in GitLab then you need to make sure to manually (or programmatically, using [Terraform](../../vendors/terraform/terraform-provider.md)) point the stack to the new location of the source code.

!!! info
    Spacelift does not support moving repositories between GitHub accounts, since Spacelift accounts are strongly linked to GitHub ones. In that case the best course of action is to take your Terraform state, download it and import it while recreating the stack (or multiple stacks) in a different account. After that, all the stacks pointing to the old repository can be safely deleted.

    Moving a repository between GitHub and GitLab or the other way around is simple, however. Just change the provider setting on the Spacelift project, and point the stack to the new source code location.

_Branch_ signifies the repository branch **tracked** by the stack. By default, that is unless a [Git push policy](../policy/push-policy/README.md) explicitly determines otherwise, a commit pushed to the tracked branch triggers a deployment represented by a **tracked** run. A push to any other branch by default triggers a test represented by a **proposed** run. More information about git push policies, tracked branches, and head commits can be found [here](../policy/push-policy/README.md#git-push-policy-and-tracked-branch).

Results of both tracked and proposed runs are displayed in the source control provider using their specific APIs - please refer to our [GitHub](../../integrations/source-control/github.md) and [GitLab](../../integrations/source-control/gitlab.md) documentation respectively to understand how Spacelift feedback is provided for your infrastructure changes.

!!! info
    A branch _must_ exist before it's pointed to in Spacelift.

### Runner image

Since every Spacelift job (which we call [runs](../run/README.md)) is executed in a separate Docker container, setting a custom runner image provides a convenient way to prepare the exact runtime environment your infra-as-code flow is designed to use.

Additionally, for our Pulumi integration overriding the default runner image is the canonical way of selecting the exact Pulumi version and its corresponding language SDK.

You can find more information about our use of Docker in [this dedicated help article](../../integrations/docker.md).

!!! info
    Runner image can be overridden by the [runtime configuration](../configuration/runtime-configuration/README.md#runner_image-setting) specified in the `.spacelift/config.yml` file.

!!! warning
    On the public worker pool, Docker images can only be pulled from [allowed registries](../../integrations/docker.md#allowed-registries-on-public-worker-pools). On private workers, images can be stored in any registry, including self-hosted ones.

### Worker pool

## Terraform-specific settings

### Version {: #terraform-version}

The Terraform version is set when a stack is created to indicate the version of Terraform that will be used with this project. However, Spacelift covers the entire [Terraform version management](../../vendors/terraform/version-management.md) story, and applying a change with a newer version will automatically update the version on the stack.

### Workspace {: #terraform-workspace}

[Terraform workspaces](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/workspaces.html){: rel="nofollow"} are supported by Spacelift, too, as long as your state backend supports them. If the workspace is set, Spacelift will try to first [_select_, and then - should that fail - automatically _create_](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/state/workspaces.html#using-workspaces){: rel="nofollow"} the required workspace on the state backend.

If you're [managing Terraform state through Spacelift](../../vendors/terraform/state-management.md), the workspace argument is ignored since Spacelift gives each stack a separate workspace by default.

## Pulumi-specific settings

### Login URL {: #pulumi-login-url}

Login URL is the address Pulumi should log into during Run initialization. Since we do not yet provide a full-featured Pulumi state backend, you need to bring your own (eg. [Amazon S3](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/#logging-into-the-aws-s3-backend){: rel="nofollow"}).

You can read more about the login process [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/reference/cli/pulumi_login/){: rel="nofollow"}. More general explanation of Pulumi state management and backends is available [here](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/intro/concepts/state/){: rel="nofollow"}.

### Stack name {: #pulumi-stackname}

The name of the Pulumi stack which should be selected for backend operations. Please do not confuse it with the [Spacelift stack name](#name-and-description) - they _may_ be different, though it's probably good if you can keep them identical.
