# User-Provided Metadata

Occasionally you might want to add additional information to your Runs which isn’t handled on a first-class basis by Spacelift. You can attach this kind of information using the run metadata parameter, which is available through [spacectl](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacectl){: rel="nofollow"} as well as the GraphQL API.

## Usage

Let’s start with a small example. You’ll need a private worker for this.

On the machine where the worker resides, create a simple policy in a file:

```opa
package spacelift
sample { true }
```

And then start the worker with an additional environment variable:

```bash
SPACELIFT_LAUNCHER_RUN_INITIALIZATION_POLICY=/path/to/your/policy.rego
```

This policy will make our launcher sample each [initialization policy](../policy/run-initialization-policy.md) evaluation and print it as a log on stderr.

We’ll also need a [Stack](../stack/README.md) to which [this worker is attached](../worker-pools.md).

We can now trigger a run and provide an arbitrary metadata string:

```console
$ spacectl stack deploy --id testing-spacelift --run-metadata "deploy-metadata"
You have successfully created a deployment
The live run can be visited at http://cube2222.app.spacelift.tf/stack/testing-spacelift/run/01FEKAGP4AYV0DWP4QDFTANRES
```

And in the private worker logs we should suitably see (formatted for readability):

```json

  "caller": "setup.go:201",
  "level": "info",
  "msg": "Sample 0/INITIALIZATION/7YGHCNF7W6VMBQ49XQ42MH4JD1/allow",

1. The metadata string

Great!

We can now go ahead and confirm this run:

```console
$ spacectl stack confirm --id testing-spacelift --run-metadata "confirm-metadata" --run 01FEKAGP4AYV0DWP4QDFTANRES
You have successfully confirmed a deployment
The live run can be visited at http://cube2222.app.spacelift.tf/stack/testing-spacelift/run/01FEKAGP4AYV0DWP4QDFTANRES
```

In the policy sample log for the relevant metadata key we’ll see an additional entry, which was added when confirming:

```json
"user_provided_metadata": [
  "deploy-metadata",
  "confirm-metadata"
]
```

And that's basically it! It's a very flexible building block which lets you build various automation and compliance helper tooling.

## Run signatures

A standard use case for this feature would be to sign your runs when you’re creating them.

You'll have to bring the infrastructure for managing keys and signatures yourself - usually you'll already have something like that internally. But in short you can create a cryptographic signature of the parameters for a run you’re about to create - based on the commit SHA, run type, stack, date, etc. - and then you can pass that signature to Spacelift when creating the run.

Later, in the initialization policy you can use the [exec function](../policy/README.md#helper-functions) to run your custom binary for verifying that signature. This way - for your most sensitive stacks - you can verify whether runs you are receiving from the Spacelift backend are legit, intentionally created by an employee of your company.

!!! tip
    We created a [reference implementation](https://github.com/spacelift-io/signed-run-reference-implementation){: rel="nofollow"} to demonstrate how to sign runs and verify signatures.
