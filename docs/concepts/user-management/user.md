# User

We consider **Users** to be all entities that can access Spacelift through the account's Identity Provider after going through the invitation flow, as described on the [User Management page](README.md).

## Access settings

Access settings can be found by clicking the button in the lower-left corner with your avatar and selecting **Personal settings**.

## Requesting an invitation

If a user wants another user to be invited, they can use **Collaborate with your team** banner, to request an invitation for a specified email address. This request will be delivered to account owners and admins to evaluate the request.

## Spaces

This page displays a list of spaces the user has access to, along with the role user has within that spaces. The list of roles and their descriptions can be found on the [User Management page](README.md).

In addition to displaying existing permissions, the user can request a role change for a space they have access to, either directly or by inheritance, by clicking **Request role change** button to the left of desired space. You can read more about [Spaces](../spaces/README.md) and [Access Control](../spaces/access-control.md) in linked articles from this documentation.

## Groups

A list of Groups reported by the Identity Provider on the most recent login will be displayed in this list.
