# User

We consider **users** to be all entities that can access Spacelift through the account's identity provider after going through the invitation flow, as described on the [User Management page](README.md).

## Access settings

Access settings can be found by hovering over your name in the bottom-left corner and selecting **Personal settings**.

## Spaces

This page displays a list of spaces the user has access to, along with the role user has within that spaces. The list of roles and their descriptions can be found on the [User Management page](README.md).

## IdP groups

A list of groups assigned to the user as reported by the identity provider on the most recent login will be displayed in this list.
