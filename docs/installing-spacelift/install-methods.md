# Install Methods

We currently have two supported methods of installing Spacelift:

- Using our [reference architecture](./reference-architecture/README.md) approach **(recommended)** .
- Using our [CloudFormation](./cloudformation/install.md) approach.

For new installations we recommend following the reference architecture approach. This provides much more flexibility to customers, and also supports installation in environments outside of AWS. Customers who are currently using the CloudFormation approach can continue to do so.

If you wish to switch from the Cloudformation-based installation to the reference architecture, check out the [migration guide](./cloudformation/v2-to-v3-migration.md).
