# Object storage

Spacelift requires access to object storage buckets to store certain pieces of data. Currently AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage and MinIO are supported.

The following table explains each of the buckets that are required. For each bucket, we indicate whether they should have versioning enabled, as well as the retention rules that should be configured. Where the retention is listed as "user configurable", you can adjust the retention to suit your needs. A suggested value is included to give you a reasonable starting point.

| Name                     | Versioning | Retention                   | Description                                                                                      |

## Access requirements

None of our buckets need public access - they just need access from the Spacelift backend services. For certain situations where access to buckets is required from outside the backend services, for example when uploading state files from the frontend, or when workers upload run logs, we rely on pre-signed URLs that are only valid for a certain period of time.

## Uploads bucket CORS configuration

The uploads bucket is used to allow users to upload certain items like Terraform state files from the frontend. To allow this to work, the bucket needs to be configured with the frontend URL as an allowed origin. The following examples show how to configure this using Terraform assuming you were hosting Spacelift at `spacelift.myorg.com`:

=== "AWS S3"
    ```terraform
    resource "aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration" "spacelift-uploads" {
        bucket = aws_s3_bucket.spacelift-uploads.id

        cors_rule {
            allowed_headers = ["*"]
            allowed_methods = ["PUT", "POST"]
            allowed_origins = ["https://spacelift.myorg.com"]
        }
    }
    ```

=== "Google Cloud Storage"
    ```terraform
    resource "google_storage_bucket" "spacelift-uploads" {
        name = # bucket name
        location = # location

        public_access_prevention = "enforced"

        cors {
            origin = ["https://spacelift.myorg.com"]
            method = ["PUT", "POST"]
            response_header = ["*"]
            max_age_seconds = 3600
        }

        ... # more configuration options
    }
    ```
=== "Azure Blob Storage"
    ```terraform
    resource "azurerm_storage_account" "spacelift_storage_account" {
      # Some of the configuration options are omitted for brevity.
      blob_properties {
        versioning_enabled = true
        cors_rule {
          allowed_headers    = ["*"]
          allowed_methods    = ["PUT", "POST"]
          allowed_origins    = ["https://spacelift.myorg.com"]
          exposed_headers    = ["*"]
          max_age_in_seconds = 3600
        }
      }
    }
    ```

Note that the platform-specific Terraform modules ([terraform-azure-spacelift-selfhosted](https://github.com/spacelift-io/terraform-azure-spacelift-selfhosted){: rel="nofollow"}, [terraform-google-spacelift-selfhosted](https://github.com/spacelift-io/terraform-google-spacelift-selfhosted){: rel="nofollow"}, [terraform-aws-spacelift-selfhosted](https://github.com/spacelift-io/terraform-aws-spacelift-selfhosted){: rel="nofollow"}) take care of the CORS configuration.
