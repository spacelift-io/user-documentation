# Provider registry

!!! warning
    This feature is currently in open public beta and is free to use regardless of your pricing plan. Once GA, it will be available as part of our [Enterprise plan](https://spacelift.io/pricing).

## Intro

While the Terraform ecosystem is vast and growing, sometimes there is no official provider for your use case, especially if you need to interface with internal or niche tooling. This is where the Spacelift provider registry comes in. It's a place where you can publish your own providers. These providers can be used both inside, and outside of Spacelift.

While in beta, this feature comes without a GUI, so you will be interacting with it programmatically. But for someone who was able to write a Terraform provider, this should be a piece of cake ðŸ˜‰

## Publishing a provider

### Assumptions

We will not be covering the process of writing a Terraform provider in this article. If you are interested in that, please refer to the [official documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/writing-custom-providers.html){: rel="nofollow"}. In this article, we will assume that you **already have a provider** that you want to publish.

We will also focus on providing step-by-step instructions for [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions){: rel="nofollow"} users. If you are using a different CI/CD tool, you will need to adapt the steps accordingly based on its documentation. Note that you don't need to use a CI/CD tool to publish a provider - you could do it from your laptop. However, we recommend using a CI/CD tool to automate the process and provide an audit trail of what's been done, when, and by whom.

Last but not least, we assume you're going to use GoReleaser to build your provider. This is by far the most common way of managing Terraform providers which need to be available for different operating systems and architectures. If you're not familiar with GoReleaser, please refer to the [official documentation](https://goreleaser.com/){: rel="nofollow"}. You can also check out Terraform's official [`terraform-provider-scaffolding` template repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-scaffolding){: rel="nofollow"} for an example of using GoReleaser with Terraform providers.

### Creating a provider

To create a provider in Spacelift, you will either need to use the [API](../../integrations/api.md) (`terraformProviderCreate` mutation) or - preferably - our Terraform provider. The latter is the easiest way to do it, as it will let you manage your provider declaratively in the future:

```terraform title="provider.tf"
resource "spacelift_terraform_provider" "provider" {
  # This is the type of your provider.
  type        = "myinternaltool"
  space_id    = "root"
  description = "Explain what this is for"
}
```

Note that we've put the provider in the `root` space. This is because we want to give everyone access to it. If you want to make it available only to a specific team, you can put it in a team-specific different space. In general, unless providers are made public, they can be accessed by all users and stacks belonging to the same space and its children (assuming they're set to inherit resources). You can read more about spaces [here](../../concepts/spaces/README.md).

It is possible to mark the provider as public, which will make it available to everyone. This is generally not recommended, as it will make it easy for others to use your provider without your knowledge. At the same time, this is the only way of sharing a provider between Spacelift accounts. If you're doing that, make sure there is nothing sensitive in your provider. In order to mark the provider as public, you need to set its [`public`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/spacelift-io/spacelift/latest/docs/resources/terraform_provider#public){: rel="nofollow"} attribute to `true`.

### Adding a GPG key

!!! warning
    Only Spacelift root admins can manage account GPG keys. If you're not a root admin, you will need to ask one to do it for you.

Terraform uses GPG keys to verify the authenticity of providers. Before you can publish a provider version, you need to register a GPG key with Spacelift. You can do that either using the [API](../../integrations/api.md) (`gpgKeyCreate` mutation) or - preferably - our CLI tool called [`spacectl`](https://github.com/spacelift-io/spacectl){: rel="nofollow"}. One reason we do not want to do it declaratively through the Terraform provider is that it would inevitably lead to the private key being stored in some Terraform state, which is not ideal. `spacectl` will let you register a GPG key without storing the private key anywhere outside of your system.

If you have an existing GPG key that you want to use, you can use `spacectl` to register it:

```bash
$ spacectl provider add-gpg-key \
    --import \
    --name="My first GPG key" \
    --path="Path to the ASCII-armored private key"
```

Alternatively, `spacectl` can generate a new key for you. Note that `spacectl` generates GPG keys without a passphrase:

```bash
$ spacectl provider add-gpg-key \
    --generate \
    --name="My first GPG key" \
    --email="Your email address" \
    --path="Path to save the ASCII-armored private key to"
```

You can list all your GPG keys using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider list-gpg-keys
```

### CI/CD setup

Now that you have a provider and a GPG key, you can set up your CI/CD tool to publish provider versions. First, let's set up the GoReleaser config file in your provider repository:

```yaml title=".goreleaser.yml"
builds:
  - env: ['CGO_ENABLED=0']
    flags: ['-trimpath']
    ldflags: ['-s -w -X main.version={{ .Version }} -X main.commit={{ .Commit }}']
    goos: [darwin, linux]
    goarch: [amd64, arm64]
    binary: '{{ .ProjectName }}_v{{ .Version }}'

archives:
  - format: zip
    name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_{{ .Os }}_{{ .Arch }}'

checksum:
  name_template: '{{ .ProjectName }}_{{ .Version }}_SHA256SUMS'
  algorithm: sha256

signs:
  - artifacts: checksum
    args:
      - "--batch"
      - "--local-user"
      - "{{ .Env.GPG_FINGERPRINT }}"
      - "--output"
      - "${signature}"
      - "--detach-sign"
      - "${artifact}"

release:
  disable: true
```

This setup assumes that the name of your project (repository) is `terraform-provider-$name`. If it is not (maybe you're using a monorepo?) then you will need to change the config accordingly, presumably by hardcoding the project name.


Next, let's make sure you have an API key for the Spacelift account you want to publish the provider to. You can refer to the [API key management](../../integrations/api.md#spacelift-api-key--token) section of the API documentation for more information on how to do that. Note that the key you're generating **must** have admin access to the space that the provider lives in. If the provider is in the `root` space, then the key must have root admin access.

We can now add a GitHub Actions workflow definition to our repository:

```yaml title=".github/workflows/release.yml"
name: release
on:
  push:

permissions:
  contents: write

jobs:
  goreleaser:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Unshallow
        run: git fetch --prune --unshallow

      - name: Set up Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v3
        with:
          go-version-file: 'go.mod'
          cache: true

      - name: Import GPG key
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-import-gpg@v5
        id: import_gpg
        with:
          # The private key must be stored in an environment variable registered
          # with GitHub. The expected format is ASCII-armored.
          #
          # If you need to use a passphrase, you can populate it in this
          # section, too.
          gpg_private_key: ${{ secrets.GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}

      - name: Install spacectl
        uses: spacelift-io/setup-spacectl@main
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Run GoReleaser
        # We will only run GoReleaser when a tag is pushed. Semantic versioning
        # is required, but build metadata is not supported.
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        uses: goreleaser/goreleaser-action@v3.2.0
        with:
          version: latest
          args: release --rm-dist
        env:
          GPG_FINGERPRINT: ${{ steps.import_gpg.outputs.fingerprint }}

      - name: Release new version
        if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
        env:
          GPG_KEY_ID: ${{ steps.import_gpg.outputs.keyid }}

          # This is the URL of the Spacelift account hosting the provider.
          SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ENDPOINT: https://youraccount.app.spacelift.io

          # This is the ID of the API key you generated earlier.
          SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_ID }}

          # This is the secret of the API key you generated earlier.
          SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SPACELIFT_API_KEY_SECRET }}
        run: # Don't forget to change the provider type!
          spacectl provider create-version --type=TYPE-change-me!!!
```

If everything is fine, pushing a tag like `v0.1.0` should create a new **draft** version of the provider in Spacelift. You can list the versions of your provider using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider list-versions --type=YOUR_PROVIDER_TYPE
```

Note the version status. Versions start their life as drafts, and you can publish them by grabbing their ID (first column) and using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider publish-version --id=YOUR_VERSION_ID
```

Once published, your version is ready to use. See the next section for more information.

## Using providers

Terraform providers hosted by Spacelift can be used the same way as providers hosted by the Terraform Registry. The only difference is that you need to specify the Spacelift registry URL in your Terraform configuration.

```terraform title="main.tf"
terraform {
  required_providers {
    yourprovider = {
      source  = "spacelift.io/your-org/yourprovider"
    }
  }
}
```

The above example does not refer to a specific version, meaning that you are going to always use the latest available (published) version of your provider. That said, you can use any versioning syntax supported by the Terraform Registry - learn more about it [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/expressions/version-constraints){: rel="nofollow"}.

### Using providers inside Spacelift

All runs in any of the stacks belonging to the provider's space or one of its children will be able to read the provider from the Spacelift registry, same as with [modules](../terraform/module-registry.md) This is because the runs are automatically authenticated to the spacelift.io registry while the run is in progress.

### Using providers outside of Spacelift

If you need to use the provider outside of Spacelift, you will need to authenticate to the registry first, either interactively (eg. on your machine) or using an API key (eg. in automation). This process is the same as with [modules](./module-registry.md#using-modules-outside-of-spacelift), so please refer to that section for more information.

Your access to the required provider will be determined by your access to the space that the provider lives in. If you have read access to the space, you will be able to use the provider.

## Other management tasks

Beyond creating and publishing new versions, there are a few other tasks you can perform on your provider. In this section we will cover the most common ones.

### Revoking GPG keys

If you lose control over your GPG key, you will want to revoke it. Revoking a key has no automatic impact on provider versions already published, but it will prevent you from publishing new versions signed with that key. You can revoke a key using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider revoke-gpg-key --key=$ID_OF_YOUR_KEY
```

If you want to also revoke any of the provider versions signed with this key, refer to the section on [revoking provider versions](#revoking-provider-versions).

### Deleting provider versions

You can permanently delete any **draft** provider version using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider delete-version --id=$ID_OF_YOUR_VERSION
```

A deleted version disappears from the list of versions, and you can reuse its number in the future.

You cannot delete published versions. If you want to disable a published version, you will need to [revoke it](#revoking-provider-versions) instead.

### Revoking provider versions

You can revoke any published provider version using `spacectl`:

```bash
$ spacectl provider revoke-version --id=$ID_OF_YOUR_VERSION
```

This will prevent anyone from using the version in the future, but it will not delete it. The version will remain on the list of versions, and will never be available again. You will not be able to reuse the version number of a revoked version.
